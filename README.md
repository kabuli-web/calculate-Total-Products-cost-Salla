# calculate-Total-Products-cost-Salla
## A python program that counts the total costs of products from an excell file of salla ecommerce platfrorm
#### Salla Platform does not show you how much is the total cost of all the products with the variations so you have to download an excell file to calculate it and even when you download the excell file it has alot of repeated entries which will mess up the count so this program solves that issue

### How to use it 
#### just download the file to a folder and add the excell file to the same folder and tname the file 'file.xlsx'.and using cmd run the app.py and it will print the total

Note You have to pip install openpyxl
